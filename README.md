# pytorch-transformers-template
This is a template for fast prototype relying on transformers, hydra, fairscale and deepspeed, etc.

### TODO List
- Distributed evaluation.
- Multiple training set.
- Resume training from checkpoint.
  - Different setup for different engines, e.g., fairscale and deepspeed, or vanilla pytorch.
